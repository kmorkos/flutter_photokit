# iOS PhotoKit Plugin for Flutter

A Flutter plugin to interact with PhotoKit on **iOS**.

## Usage
To use this plugin, add `flutter_photokit` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/)

Then, include the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` permission in your [Info.plist](./example/ios/Runner/Info.plist)

### Example
For an example on how to use this plugin, check out the [sample app](./example/lib/main.dart)

For simplicity, the sample app just shows an example of saving a photo, but this plugin will work for videos as well! Usage is exactly the same.
